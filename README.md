# wolframalpha-calculator-3d-models

Attached is the 3d models for the wolfram alpha calculator project.
This is a calculator that shows full step-by-step instructions to solve complex math problems.

You can see it in action here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwb0BAe3mJg

The button holes are based off of the removable keypad from the TI-NSpire. ![NSPIRE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-Nspire_series#/media/File:TI-Nspire.jpg)

The removable keypad has a 30 pin header on the top wired in matrix that can easily be interface by a raspberry pi. Info on this is available in keypad_pinout.pdf.

The middle plate has a cutout that should fit a standard 3000mAh battery. There is also 4 feet to mount a Adafruit powerboost for a charging circuit.

The screen is an unknown TFT panel connected over analog.
